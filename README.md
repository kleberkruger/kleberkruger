- 👋 Hi, I’m @kleberkruger
- 👀 I'm a doctoral student interested in software development in general. I like C/C++, Java, web development, and Python (just kidding, Python is for kids)
- 🌱 I’m currently researching computer architecture, especially checkpointing strategies for Non-Volatile Memories using Processing-in-Memory
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the donuts project, available at https://github.com/kleberkruger/donuts
- 📫 To contact me, send me an email at kleberkruger@gmail.com
